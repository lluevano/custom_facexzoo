# Modules
These modules are meant for running before the Backbone of the FaceModel.
You can define your own modules in "module_def.py"
By default, the configuration file is located in "../training_mode/module_conf.yaml"
The FaceModel class in "../training_mode/conventional_training/train.py" is able to load these modules before the backbone.
